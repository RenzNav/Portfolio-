# Portfolio-
I followed the “Responsive Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS & JavaScript” tutorial on YouTube as the foundational framework for building my personal portfolio site. The tutorial provided a well-structured starting point, covering layout structure, responsive design principles, and basic animations.

To make the portfolio uniquely my own, I significantly customized both the CSS and site structure. I:
- Redesigned the visual style by modifying the CSS, including changes to typography, colors, spacing, and hover effects to better align with my personal brand.
- Added a custom footer section containing contact links, copyright, and social icons.
- Created additional pages (e.g., Projects, Blog, or Resume sections), ensuring consistent styling and navigation throughout the site.
- Made performance and accessibility tweaks, including semantic HTML updates and improved mobile responsiveness.

This process allowed me to reinforce my frontend development skills while also practicing responsive design, user experience refinement, and modular coding practices.
